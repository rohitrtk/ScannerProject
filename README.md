# ScannerProject

Assignment for Computer Science class. Program will be used by teachers to sign their students in using their student cards and a bar code scanner. Program will store user data locally, hopefully online in a later iteration using SQL, and be able to send an email home to the students parent if they were late/absent in class.

**Use only as reference please.**
